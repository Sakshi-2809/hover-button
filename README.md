# ✨ Animated Border Hover Button (CSS)

A stylish **hover button animation** created using pure HTML and CSS.  
The button displays animated glowing borders that move smoothly around the button on hover, creating a modern neon-style effect.

## 📝 About the Project

This project demonstrates how **CSS positioning, transitions, gradients, and pseudo-animation techniques** can be used to design an interactive button without JavaScript.

The border animation is achieved using multiple `<span>` elements that animate individually on hover, giving the illusion of a glowing outline moving around the button.
